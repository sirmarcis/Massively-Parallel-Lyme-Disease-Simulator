Each index is a lattice node.
The lattice space wraps around itself.
At first, there are 2400 lattice nodes with 800 mice initially.
Next, they use 32000 nodes and 8000 mice.
Mice are located in every other node - like a checkerboard.
Mice move in a random direction (1 of 8); ticks are not immobile.
Node size is 400 m^2. 
Ticks are placed in the space in a #-column band at every 4th row.

A mouse moves in a certain direction until it finds an empty nesting site.
If the mouse cannot find an empty site within a certain number of steps, it dies.
A mouse can also die of other causes, which are modeled by the random selection of the life span
for each mouse.

Density of the ticks:
When a mouse gets bitten, it can have 10 inidivual larval bites or 5 nymphal bites.
When there is a drop off event, the ticks turn into the next stage and the tick density of the node where 
they drop off is updated. 

Larva -> Nymph -> Adult

At time 0, there are only nymphs. At time 90, larva enter the simulation.

In several nodes, there are going to be infected ticks. When mice pass through these nodes, they become infected.
Once ticks drop off, that node becomes infected. 

There are five different classes of ticks:
- larva
- uninfected nymphs
- infected nymphs
- uninfected adults
- infected adults

The percentage of the class of tick is the probability that the type of the tick latches onto
the mouse.

Define Class for Mouse

Mouse
-int lifespan
-bool has disease
-bool carrying
-carrying type of tick

For deers:
There are less per node.
More adults can latch on.
Only adults can bite.
They move faster
